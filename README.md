## What is lwul?

`lwul` is a tiny, dependency-free set of utility functions for everyday Python use.  
Simple to drop into any project without any setup.

## How to Use

Here are 2 simple options:

1. **Copy `lwul.py` into your project**  
   Place `lwul.py` next to your script and import it:
   ```python
   from lwul import your_function
   ```

2. **Copy-paste** the specific function(s) you need directly into your code.

No setup, no packages, no hassle — just useful code ready to go.

## Demo

Simply run the script directly to see all testable functions in action:
```bash
python lwul.py
```
